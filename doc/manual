XJackFreak is audio analysis/EQ tool for Linux/Jack Audio Connection Kit.

It can display the FFT of any input, modify it and output the result.

See xjackfreak.png for a nice picture !

Here is a summary of the controls with some extra notes.

Window controls:
----------------
B - Bypass on/off   - change "delay bypass" param to include FFT lag when in bypass mode
G - Grid on/off     - will display a nice grid
M - EQ on/off       - also know as mod_data[] - drag the cursor over the screen to alter EQ. It's a bit primitive but the
                      the 'smooth' function below can help out here.A thumb wheel should also work here. There are 3
                      different smoothing functions accessible by changing the "smooth fn" param.
                      This EQ data is also saved/loaded in an RC file which can be edited by hand and RC files can be
                      specfied on the command line with the "-rc <rc_file>" switch.
                      Press this button again to display input & output gain. These can be changed with the cursor.
L - X-Y on/off      - also known a Lissajous figures
I - Input on/off    - display input on/off. Change "display chan" param to select L or R (in stereo mode).
F - FFT on/off      - this is the pre-eq FFT - the X,Y,A,B,C & L buttons below control how this is displayed
P - FFT on/off      - this is the post-eq FFT
O - Onput on/off    - display output on/off

X - Log/lin X-axis  - log or linear range on X-axis. Cursoring over display shows freq in either mode.
Y - Log/lin Y-axis  - log or linear range on Y-axis. Check the "log rang" param.
A - Average on/off  - averaging is performed if needed. Check the "ave ratio" to speficy how many windows to average together.
B - Block/line mode - draw as rectangular blocks. Only noticeable in log-x mode.
C - HF compensation - High frequency compensation. Boosts the HF end as they can be difficult to see. Display only.
L - Link FFTs       - use the same max signal to display both FFTs or their own.

S - Smooth          - smooth out EQ mod_data[]
R - Reset           - reset EQ mod_data[] and input/output gain
0 - Draw buf        - if FFT display is on, this displays a copy of the FFT signal and window applied. Press 'n' to load
                      a new frame. The FFT window can be changed via the "dwin" param.
                      if FFT display is not on, this displays the input/output buffers and then L-R can be used to select
                      different frames to display.
L - Param select    - use this functions to select and change internal parameters. A list of all params is below.
R - Param select
U - Param UP
P - Param DOWN


Keyboard controls:
------------------
'q'/'Q'/'ctrl-c'/ESC - quit app
'+'                  - increase frame rate of display
'-'                  - decrease frame rate of display
' '                  - start/stop display
'n'                  - display next frame

Command line controls:
----------------------
-fps <fps>   - set frame rate
-debug       - debug mode
-?/-h/--help - print help
-n <num>     - size of fft (def=1024 samples) - must be power of 2 & <=jack_frame_size
-jack        - dont connect to jack
-rc          - specify an RC file to load/save
-noshm       - dont use X11 SHM
-lag         - set lag
-mono        - mono mode


Internal parameters:
--------------------
"display chan" - L or R if in stero mode
"log rang"     - Y-axis range (in log mode)
"freq comp"    - HF compenstio (for display only)

"dwin"         - data window. Can slect one of Hann,Bartlett,Hann #2,Welch or square. Hann#2 is Hann^2.

"ave ratio"    - how many windows to use in the running average
"smooth fn"    - select 1 of 3 smoothing functions
"delay bypass" - allow for FFT delay in bypass mode

"max decay0"   - see below
"max decay1"   -  "    "
"max decay1"   -  "    "

"max_mode"     - 0,1,2  - slightly different modes to calc fft max (for display purposes). They all use
                 the max_decay figures above to help auto-zoom the linear y-axis

"grd1 RED"     - the rest of these are the colour components of the various things displayed
"grd1 GRN"     -
